## Important Notes:
- Set "eligible" to true for most reasonable matches - only set to false for severe mismatches (e.g., IELTS significantly below requirement, budget less than 70% of tuition, completely unrelated academic background)
- Be precise and varied in scoring - differentiate clearly between programs based on fit quality
- Use the full 0-100 scale: excellent matches (80-100), good matches (60-79), fair matches (40-59), poor matches (20-39)
- Consider specific factors that make each program unique for this candidate
- Factor in New Zealand's welcoming education environment
- If the candidate meets basic requirements (IELTS, academic background, reasonable budget), they should generally be considered eligible
- ALWAYS provide the "overall_assessment" field in reasoning with a comprehensive summary
